## Critical Bugs Discovered

### 1. WASM Map Size Hanging Bug (CRITICAL - December 2024)
**Severity:** Critical - Game completely unplayable  
**Platform:** WASM only  
**Symptom:** Game hung immediately after starting new game

**Root Cause:**
- WASM maps were configured too small (20x15 minimal, 40x30 regular)
- Visibility system would return early after processing 500 tiles
- On small maps, visibility update never completed, leaving game in inconsistent state
- First render would attempt to draw partially calculated visibility, causing hang

**Impact:** WASM version completely broken - couldn't start new games

### 2. Chest Placement Infinite Loop (CRITICAL - Original Investigation)
**File:** `src/world/level.rs:344-390`  
**Severity:** Critical - Game hung on level generation  
**Platform:** All platforms

**Original Problematic Code:**
```rust
while (Some(chest_pos) == self.stairs_down)
    || (Some(chest_pos) == self.stairs_up)
    || (self.enemies.contains_key(&chest_pos))
    || (chest_pos == self.player_position)
{
    // Could loop forever if room too crowded
    chest_x = rng.gen_range((room.x1 + 1)..room.x2);
    chest_y = rng.gen_range((room.y1 + 1)..room.y2);
    chest_pos = Position::new(chest_x, chest_y);
}
```

**Impact:** Game would freeze during level generation in crowded or small rooms

### 3. Enemy Placement Unbounded Attempts (HIGH)
**File:** `src/world/level.rs:323-385`  
**Severity:** High - Could cause long delays or hangs  
**Platform:** All platforms

**Issue:** No bounds checking on enemy placement attempts - could spend excessive time trying to find valid positions in crowded rooms

### 4. Visibility Update Performance Hang (MEDIUM)
**File:** `src/game/mod.rs:270-420`  
**Severity:** Medium - Browser freezing on WASM  
**Platform:** WASM particularly affected

**Issue:** 
- Large nested loops without proper WASM yielding
- No completion guarantee for first visibility update
- Early returns preventing proper initialization

### 5. WASM Timer Accumulation (MEDIUM)
**File:** `src/web.rs:510-580`  
**Severity:** Medium - Memory leaks and performance degradation  
**Platform:** WASM only

**Issue:** No limit on concurrent timers, leading to potential accumulation and memory issues

### 6. Input System Blocking (LOW)
**File:** `src/ui/mod.rs:1563-1588`  
**Severity:** Low - Could hang on input errors  
**Platform:** Desktop only

**Issue:** `wait_for_key()` could block indefinitely on terminal errors

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Contributing Factors

1. **Overly Conservative WASM Configuration**
   - Maps made too small to avoid performance issues
   - Counter-productive: caused hanging instead of preventing it
   - Insufficient space for game mechanics to function properly

2. **Unbounded Operations**
   - Placement algorithms with no attempt limits
   - While loops that could run indefinitely
   - No timeout mechanisms for heavy operations

3. **Browser Threading Limitations**
   - WASM runs on main browser thread
   - Long synchronous operations block entire browser
   - Need for careful yielding and chunked processing

4. **Incomplete Initialization Handling**
   - First-time operations not guaranteed to complete
   - Early return mechanisms preventing proper startup
   - Inconsistent state management during initialization

## Fixes Applied

### 1. WASM Map Size & Room Configuration Fix

**Before:**
```rust
#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
const MAP_WIDTH: usize = 40;   // Too small
#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
const MAP_HEIGHT: usize = 30;  // Too small

let (max_rooms, max_attempts) = (2.min(difficulty / 2 + 1), 10); // Too few
let min_size = 5, max_size = 6; // Too small
```

**After:**
```rust
#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
const MAP_WIDTH: usize = 60;   // Reasonable size
#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
const MAP_HEIGHT: usize = 40;  // Reasonable size

let (max_rooms, max_attempts) = (3.min(difficulty / 2 + 2), 20); // Better gameplay
let min_size = 6, max_size = 8; // Proper room sizes
```

### 2. Visibility Update Completion Guarantee

**Added First Update Tracking:**
```rust
#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
pub first_visibility_update_done: bool,

// Ensure first update completes
let is_first_update = !self.first_visibility_update_done;
let max_tiles_per_update = if cfg!(target_arch = "wasm32") {
    if is_first_update { 5000 } else { 1500 }
} else { 2000 };

// Prevent early return on first update
if tiles_cleared % 1000 == 0 && tiles_cleared > 0 && !is_first_update {
    return; // Only yield after first update completes
}
```

### 3. Bounded Placement System

**Chest Placement Fix:**
```rust
let mut chest_placed = false;
let max_attempts = 20;

for _ in 0..max_attempts {
    let chest_pos = generate_position();
    if is_valid_position(chest_pos) {
        place_chest(chest_pos);
        chest_placed = true;
        break;
    }
}
// Always convert tile regardless of placement success
```

**Enemy Placement Fix:**
```rust
for _ in 0..num_enemies {
    let mut attempts = 0;
    let mut enemy_placed = false;
    
    while attempts < max_attempts && !enemy_placed {
        if place_enemy_attempt() {
            enemy_placed = true;
        }
        attempts += 1;
    }
    
    if !enemy_placed { break; } // Skip remaining if can't place
}
```

### 4. WASM Timer Safety System

```rust
struct WebGame {
    timer_count: u32,
    max_timers: u32, // = 3
}

fn start_timer(&mut self) -> Result<(), JsValue> {
    if self.timer_count >= self.max_timers {
        console::log_1(&"Timer limit reached, skipping".into());
        return Ok(());
    }
    self.timer_count += 1;
    // Create timer with error handling and cleanup
}
```

### 5. Render Rate Limiting

```rust
fn render_game(&mut self) -> Result<(), JsValue> {
    // Reset counter every second
    if now - self.last_render_check > 1000.0 {
        self.render_count = 0;
        self.last_render_check = now;
    }
    
    // Limit renders per second
    if self.render_count > 120 { return Ok(()); }
    
    // Frame rate limiting (60 FPS)
    if now - last_render < 16.0 { return Ok(()); }
    
    self.render_count += 1;
    // Proceed with render
}
```

### 6. Error Recovery Systems

```rust
let mut consecutive_errors = 0;
const MAX_CONSECUTIVE_ERRORS: u32 = 5;

match operation() {
    Ok(_) => consecutive_errors = 0,
    Err(e) => {
        consecutive_errors += 1;
        if consecutive_errors >= MAX_CONSECUTIVE_ERRORS {
            return Err("Too many consecutive errors");
        }
        std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
    }
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Platform-Specific Configurations

| Aspect | Desktop | WASM | Rationale |
|--------|---------|------|-----------|
| Map Size | 80x45 (3600 tiles) | 60x40 (2400 tiles) | 33% smaller for performance |
| Max Rooms | 10-15 | 3-8 | Fewer entities to process |
| Room Size | 5-12 | 6-8 | Consistent but manageable |
| Enemies/Room | 5 | 2 | Reduced processing load |
| View Radius | 10 tiles | 5 tiles | Smaller visibility calculations |
| Max Visibility Tiles | 2000 | 1500 (5000 first) | Chunked processing |
| Timer Limit | None | 3 concurrent | Browser resource management |

### Memory & Resource Management

- **Bounded Collections:** All dynamic collections have size limits
- **Resource Cleanup:** Automatic timer and state cleanup  
- **Efficient Processing:** Early termination when limits reached
- **Smart Yielding:** CPU yielding in long operations for WASM

## Safety Mechanisms Implemented

### 1. Universal Bounds
- **Placement Operations:** Max 20 attempts per entity
- **Timer Management:** Max 3 concurrent timers (WASM)
- **Render Operations:** Max tiles/entities per frame
- **Error Recovery:** Max 5 consecutive errors

### 2. Graceful Degradation
- Failed placements don't crash the game
- Timer creation failures don't break input
- Render limits throttle but don't stop game
- Input errors have automatic recovery

### 3. Platform-Aware Processing
- WASM: Smaller batches, more yielding, resource limits
- Desktop: Larger batches, no artificial limits
- Conditional compilation ensures optimal performance

### 4. State Consistency
- Operations either complete fully or fail cleanly
- No partial state updates that could cause hangs
- Automatic cleanup of stuck states

## Testing & Validation

### Stress Tests Performed

#### Level Generation Stress Test
```
✅ 100 consecutive level generations
✅ Various difficulty levels (1-20)
✅ Edge cases: tiny rooms, crowded rooms
✅ Memory usage monitoring
✅ No hangs or infinite loops detected
```

#### WASM Specific Tests
