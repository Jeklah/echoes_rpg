# Fullscreen and Display Area Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the enhancements made to the Windows GUI version to enable fullscreen mode, increase the game display area, and improve content centering to prevent text truncation and provide a better gaming experience.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Small Window Size
- **Problem**: Default window size (1000x700) was too small for optimal gameplay
- **Impact**: Limited visibility of game content and cramped display

### 2. Text Truncation in Symbol Legends
- **Problem**: Symbol legend text was being cut off due to insufficient display area
- **Impact**: Users couldn't see complete game information

### 3. Content Not Properly Centered
- **Problem**: Game content appeared slightly to the left in the window
- **Impact**: Uneven margins and poor visual balance

### 4. Limited Game View Area
- **Problem**: Small map view (70x25) didn't utilize available screen space
- **Impact**: Reduced situational awareness and gameplay experience

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fullscreen Mode
**Before:**
```rust
.with_inner_size([1000.0, 700.0])
.with_min_inner_size([800.0, 600.0])
```

**After:**
```rust
.with_fullscreen(true)
.with_maximized(true)
.with_resizable(true)
```

- Window now starts in fullscreen mode
- Users can toggle between fullscreen and windowed mode
- Better utilization of available screen real estate

### 2. Increased Terminal Buffer Size
**Before:**
```rust
terminal_size: (80, 25),
terminal_buffer: vec![String::new(); 25],
color_buffer: vec![vec![...; 80]; 25],
```

**After:**
```rust
terminal_size: (120, 40),
terminal_buffer: vec![String::new(); 40],
color_buffer: vec![vec![...; 120]; 40],
```

- 50% increase in width (80 → 120 characters)
- 60% increase in height (25 → 40 lines)
- More space for detailed game information

### 3. Enhanced Font and Sizing
**Before:**
```rust
font_size: 14.0,
char_width: 8.0,
char_height: 16.0,
```

**After:**
```rust
font_size: 16.0,
char_width: 9.6,
char_height: 19.2,
```

- Larger, more readable font
- Better character spacing
- Improved readability on fullscreen displays

### 4. Expanded Game View Area
**Before:**
```rust
let view_width = 70;
let view_height = 25;
let start_y = 5;
```

**After:**
```rust
let view_width = 90;
let view_height = 35;
let start_y = 3;
```

- 29% increase in map view width
- 40% increase in map view height
- Better positioning to maximize screen usage

### 5. Improved Layout Calculations
**New Dynamic Sizing:**
```rust
let available_size = ui.available_size();
let margin = 40.0; // Small margin from edges
let usable_width = available_size.x - margin;
let usable_height = available_size.y - margin;

let max_cols = ((usable_width / char_width) as usize).min(self.terminal_size.0);
let max_rows = ((usable_height / char_height) as usize).min(self.terminal_size.1);
```

- Content adapts to actual screen size
- Maintains small margins for visual comfort
- Prevents content from touching screen edges

### 6. Better Content Centering
**New Layout Structure:**
```rust
ui.allocate_ui_with_layout(
    egui::Vec2::new(usable_width, usable_height),
    egui::Layout::top_down(egui::Align::Center),
    |ui| {
        ui.vertical_centered(|ui| {
            // Perfectly centered content
        });
    },
);
```

- True center alignment using `allocate_ui_with_layout`
- Proper vertical and horizontal centering
- Content stays centered regardless of screen size

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Responsive Design
- Content automatically scales to screen size
- Maintains aspect ratios and readability
- Works on different screen resolutions

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Efficient layout calculations
- Reduced UI complexity
- Better memory usage with proper buffer sizing

### 3. User Experience Enhancements
- Immersive fullscreen gameplay
- Better visibility of game elements
- No more truncated text in legends
- Professional, polished appearance
