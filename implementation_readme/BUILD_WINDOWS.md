# Building for Windows

This guide explains how to create a Windows executable (.exe) for Echoes RPG from a Linux development environment.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install MinGW Cross-Compiler

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mingw-w64
```

On Arch Linux:
```bash
sudo pacman -S mingw-w64-gcc
```

On Fedora/RHEL:
```bash
sudo dnf install mingw64-gcc
```

### 2. Add Windows Target to Rust

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

## Building Methods

### Method 1: Using the Build Script (Recommended)

The easiest way to build for Windows is using the provided build script:

```bash
./build-windows.sh
```

This script will:
- Check if the Windows target is installed
- Build the Windows executable
- Create a copy named `echoes_rpg_windows.exe` in the project root

### Method 2: Manual Build

You can also build manually using Cargo:

```bash
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

The executable will be created at:
```
target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/echoes_rpg.exe
```

### Method 3: Using Cargo Alias

If you have the `.cargo/config.toml` file configured, you can use:

```bash
cargo build-windows
```

## Configuration

The project includes a `.cargo/config.toml` file that configures the MinGW linker for Windows builds. This ensures proper linking and optimization for Windows executables.

## Testing the Windows Executable

Since we're cross-compiling from Linux, you won't be able to run the Windows executable directly on your Linux system. To test it:

1. Copy the `.exe` file to a Windows machine
2. Run it from Command Prompt or PowerShell
3. Or use Wine on Linux (though this may not work perfectly for all terminal applications)

## File Size and Optimization

The build is configured with the following optimizations in `Cargo.toml`:

- `opt-level = 3` - Maximum optimization
- `lto = true` - Link-time optimization
- `codegen-units = 1` - Single codegen unit for better optimization
- `panic = "abort"` - Smaller binary size
- `strip = true` - Remove debug symbols

The resulting executable should be around 500-600KB in size.

## Troubleshooting

### MinGW Not Found
If you get linker errors, ensure MinGW is properly installed and the `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc` command is available in your PATH.

### Target Not Installed
If you get "target not installed" errors, run:
```bash
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

### Build Warnings
The build may show warnings about unused code. These are normal for a development build and don't affect the functionality of the Windows executable.

## Alternative: MSVC Target

While this guide uses the GNU toolchain (MinGW), you can also build using the MSVC toolchain if you have access to Visual Studio Build Tools:

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

However, this requires Windows-specific build tools and is not recommended for cross-compilation from Linux.

## Windows-Specific Features

### Fog of War Enhancement

The Windows build includes special fog of war rendering optimizations:

- **Complete Invisibility**: Undiscovered areas are rendered with true invisibility instead of darkened tiles
- **Terminal Compatibility**: Addresses color rendering differences between Windows and Linux terminals
- **Better Gameplay**: Ensures fog of war works as intended on all Windows terminal types

This fix resolves issues where Windows terminals (Command Prompt, PowerShell, Windows Terminal) would show darkened fog of war areas that were still partially visible, making exploration less challenging.

### Input Handling Enhancement

The Windows build includes special input handling optimizations:

- **Single Key Press Processing**: Filters out key release events that cause double input on Windows terminals
- **Combat Input Fix**: Resolves issue where combat actions would trigger twice (e.g., pressing '2' for abilities would auto-select twice)
- **Movement Fix**: Prevents double movement where pressing arrow keys would move two spaces instead of one
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Maintains normal input behavior on Linux while fixing Windows-specific issues

This enhancement addresses the difference in how Windows terminals handle key events compared to Linux terminals, ensuring responsive and accurate input handling across all Windows terminal applications.

### Performance Optimizations

The Windows build includes comprehensive performance optimizations to significantly improve frame rates:

- **Batched Rendering**: Instead of individual terminal operations per character, the Windows version batches all rendering operations together
- **Reduced Color Changes**: Minimizes expensive color switching operations by grouping similar colors
- **Frame Rate Limiting**: Implements ~60 FPS cap to prevent excessive terminal load and improve responsiveness
- **Optimized Screen Updates**: Uses `queue!` instead of `execute!` for better Windows terminal performance
- **Smart Redraw Logic**: Only redraws the screen when necessary, reducing unnecessary terminal operations
- **Buffered Output**: Uses explicit buffer flushing for more efficient terminal communication

**Performance Improvements:**
- Up to 5-10x faster rendering on Windows Terminal
