# Chest Interaction Fix Summary

## Problems Identified

1. **Missing 'g' key functionality**: The game did not handle the 'g' key press for manual item pickup, which is a common expectation in RPG games.

2. **User confusion about chest interaction**: The user expected to press 'g' while standing next to a chest, but the game only supported automatic looting when walking directly into chests.

3. **Unclear feedback**: When chest interaction failed, there was no clear feedback to the player about what went wrong.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added 'g' Key Handling

**File**: `echoes_rpg/src/game/mod.rs`
- Added `KeyCode::Char('g')` case in the main game input handling loop
- Calls new `try_get_item()` method when 'g' is pressed
- Displays result message to the UI

```rust
crossterm::event::KeyCode::Char('g') => {
    // Try to get item at current position or adjacent chest
    if let Some(result) = game.try_get_item() {
        ui.add_message(result);
    }
}
```

### 2. Implemented try_get_item() Method

**File**: `echoes_rpg/src/game/mod.rs`
- New method that handles manual item pickup and chest interaction
- Checks current player position for items first
- Then checks all 4 adjacent positions (up, down, left, right) for:
  - Chests that can be looted
  - Items on the ground
- Provides appropriate feedback messages for all scenarios

**Key Features**:
- **Current position check**: Picks up items at player's current location
- **Adjacent chest detection**: Finds chests next to the player
- **Chest looting logic**: Extracts items from chests and converts chest tiles to floor
- **Error handling**: Handles full inventory and empty chests gracefully
- **Clear feedback**: Provides specific messages for each interaction type

### 3. Enhanced User Feedback

The new system provides clear messages for various scenarios:
- `"You picked up an item."` - Item successfully picked up
- `"You looted the chest!"` - Chest successfully looted
- `"The chest is empty."` - Chest exists but contains no items
- `"Chest is full of treasure, but [inventory full message]."` - Chest has items but inventory is full
- `"There's nothing here to pick up."` - No items or chests nearby

## Technical Details

### Chest Detection Logic
```rust
// Check adjacent positions for chests or items
let directions = [(0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (1, 0)]; // up, down, left, right

for (dx, dy) in directions.iter() {
    let adj_pos = Position::new(player_pos.x + dx, player_pos.y + dy);
    
    if let Some(tile) = self.current_level().get_tile(adj_pos.x, adj_pos.y) {
        if tile.tile_type == TileType::Chest {
            // Handle chest interaction
        }
    }
}
```

### Chest State Management
- When a chest is successfully looted, it's converted from a chest tile to a floor tile
- The item is removed from the level's item collection
- This prevents the same chest from being looted multiple times

## Backward Compatibility

The fixes maintain full backward compatibility:
- **Automatic chest looting** when walking into chests still works as before
- **Existing controls** (movement, inventory, character) remain unchanged
- **No breaking changes** to existing game mechanics

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic functionality**: Press 'g' next to a chest and verify it gets looted
2. **Empty chests**: Verify appropriate message for chests without items
3. **Full inventory**: Test behavior when inventory is full
4. **No nearby items**: Test 'g' press when nothing is nearby
5. **Ground items**: Test 'g' press when standing on or near ground items
6. **Multiple adjacents**: Test when multiple chests/items are adjacent

## Debug Features Added

Temporary debug output has been added to help verify the functionality:
- Logs when 'g' key is pressed and player position
- Logs when chests are found and their contents
- Logs when chests are empty

These can be removed once testing is complete.

## Files Modified

1. `echoes_rpg/src/game/mod.rs` - Main game logic and input handling
2. `echoes_rpg/src/world/level.rs` - Temporary debug output for chest generation

The implementation is focused and minimal, adding only the necessary functionality without disrupting existing systems.
